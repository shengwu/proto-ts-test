how ergonomic is it to do protobuf over http, between the browser and a server?

# addl questions
- is there a good typescript generator for protobuf types and client and server code
  - does it handle proto3 syntax (default value == empty) well?
- is there a good open source setup for typescript/react frontend and typescript backend
